This program produces all of the answers for the Spelling Bee game by Frank Longo in the New York Times Magazine.
The rules of Spelling Bee are as follows:

"How many common words of 5 or more letters can you spell using the letters in the hive?
Every answer must use the center letter at least once. Letters may be reused in a word.
At least 1 word will use all 7 letters. Proper names and hyphenated words are not allowed.
Score 1 point for each answer, and 3 points for a word that uses all 7 letters."

Sidenote: this program can accept more or less than 7 letters when setting parameters.

Make sure to have the "DictionaryList1.txt" file in the same folder as the .py file.
